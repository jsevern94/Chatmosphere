## 📝 Description :
### Chatmosphere enables a seamless communication using the latest web technology. It is a stand-alone web application that runs using the package called Socket IO, the most cutting edge in peer to peer communication using NodeJs . Chatmosphere works like your regular chat application with one key twist! (available in future release) Your identities are not revealed in the first few messages , only when you chose to connect to the stranger and if its mutual is when your identities will be revealed .

> This chat application enables the users to communicate thru private messaging via a web socket technology .

> You can share information about yourself, create a friends list, & chat strangers.

## ✔️ Motivation  
### As we all know , data is and will be the number one commodity in our age today , data is the currency of the web . We want to create a chat platform for people who dont want their share their identities and keep their messages secure . 

> We also wanted to challenge ourselves by using new technologies. Using web sockets is conceptually different than client/server request/response networking. Tailwind CSS is a design framework that enables a seamless yet swift rendering of the web page design .

## 🔨Key-Technologies 

> ⚡️ Socket.Io - Main technology that enables the use of web-sockets to communicate to another computer

> 🍏 Tailwind CSS - CSS framework that focuses on utility for rapidly building custom designs.

> 🎡 Handlebars - Templating tool 

> 💾 MySQL / JawsDb -  Database

- [ ] Enable masking of the identities on "get to know" phase .

### 🚀 Release 4
