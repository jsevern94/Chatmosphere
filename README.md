### Chatmosphere enables a seamless communication using the latest web technology. It is a stand-alone web application that runs using the technology called Socket Io, themost cutting edge in peer to peer communication using NodeJs . Chatmosphere works like your regular chatapplication with one key twist! Your identities are not revealed in the first few messages , only whenyou chose to connect to the stranger and if its mutual is when your identities will be revealed 

## 🏠 [Homepage](https://github.com/ziakeb/project_chatmosphere/)

## 📝 Description 

> We created a chat application (using web sockets) that allows users to send private messages to each other.

> You can share information about yourself, create a friends list, & chat strangers.

## ✔️ Motivation  

> We wanted to create a chat platform for people who don’t want Mark Zuckerberg to read their private communication.

> We won’t give your data to the NSA (on purpose).

> We also wanted to challenge ourselves by using new technologies. Using web sockets is conceptually different than client/server request/response networking. Tailwind CSS is…..

## 🌱 Version 1.0 Release Notes :

### This is the summary of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for the application:

- [x] Created an authentication for users to sign-up
- [x] Create a chat application that enables communication between two users

## 🚀 Roadmap :

> Our vision for the application is to set it apart among the ranks of chat application already in the market. We want to create an application that will solve a pain-point for users who want to connect with another individual who has the same interest and for the decision to be **mutual** . To enable the developers vision of the application the following updates should be accomplished :

### 🚀 Release 2
> This release would be the addition of the basic elements and functionality of a social app

- [ ] Ability to add to friendslist
- [ ] Ability to upload and edit profile pictures


### 🚀 Release 3
> This release would would be the main platform that sets the chat application apart. 

- [ ] Enable a "chat with random" within the application 
- [ ] Enable masking of the identities on "get to know" phase .

### 🚀 Release 4
> This update enhances the usability of the application by employing a survey and matching algorithm .

- [ ] Enables users to match with another individual based on the their tapered survey questions .
- [ ] Addition of a matching algorithm .
